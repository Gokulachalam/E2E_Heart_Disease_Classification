# E2E_Heart_Disease_Classification
This repository consists the code for classifying whether a person will suffer from a heart attack or not . Here I have used the ensemble learning model.

## Dataset Description
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease

## Libraries Used

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
* gzip
* joblib


# Steps Done

1. Fetching The Dataset.

we can import from the local library but it will take too much time for loading . To prevent this we are fetching the datasetfrom the openml.

2. Splitting The Dataset,

3. Reshaping The Dataset.

4. Modelling the Classifier Model - Classification.

5. Evaluation is done by using the evaluation metrics.

6. Dumping the model by using the joblib library.

7. Creating the GUI for the user interaction.
